# Project 1: Taking a Shot at the Free Throw

My colleagues and I have sought out to answer vital questions on the effect of free throws in NBA game wins. We are looking to identify whether free throw attempts or free throw made percentage is correlated to game wins. A plaguing question in regards to free throws has always been if referres are biased towards home teams when it comes to calling fouls? Such a bias would lead to home teams having more free throw attempts, which could impact the result of the game. We will also evaluate free throws against field goals to see the actual impact of free throws in a game. 

The data we shall emass is crucial for decision-making. It will assist teams in developing a suitable game winning strategy for free-throws!
